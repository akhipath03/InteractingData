# Indigenous Populations in Canada and Mental Health

## Project Overview
This project provides an interactive analysis of mental health in Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in Canada. Using Python for data visualization and HTML/CSS for presentation, this project explores:
- The proportion of Canadians who identify as Indigenous.
- The geographical distribution of Indigenous populations in Canada.
- The relationship between mental health and social/socioeconomic factors among Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.

## Project Structure

### `index.html`

1. **Donut Chart**: Visualizes the proportion of Canadians who identify as Indigenous.
2. **Subplots**: Highlights the three Canadian provinces with the highest proportion of Indigenous individuals.
3. **Map Chart**: Shows the geographical distribution of Indigenous populations across Canada.
4. **Scatter Chart**: Examines the relationship between mental health and social/socioeconomic factors in Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.

### `Styles.css`
The CSS stylesheet that defines the visual styling of the webpage, including the navigation bar, headers, image containers, and footnotes.

### `Images/`
A folder containing the HTML and png files for each interactive chart embedded in the main webpage using iframes:
- `donut.html`: The Donut Chart.
- `subplots.html`: The Subplots.
- `map.html`: The Map Chart.
- `scatter.html`: The Scatter Chart.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
