        <h1>Mental Health in Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Populations in Canada</h1>
        <p>In this web page, we dive into data related to mental health in Canadian Indigenous 
            populations. We explore the proportions of First Nations, Inuit, Métis, and non-Indigenous 
            populations in Canada, analyze the geographical distribution of Indigenous populations in provinces 
            and territories, and investigate the relationship between mental health and social/socioeconomic 
            factors among Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.</p>

            <p class="footnote">As seen in the donut chart, Non Indigenous people make up over 94% of the Canadian Population. 
                Out of the three Indigenous groups shown, First Ntaions make up the majority, almost 4%.

            <p class="footnote">Indigenous populations are predominantly concentrated in northern Canada, with both Nunavut and the 
                Northwest Territories having Indigenous majorities. In Nunavut, the majority of the population identifies as Inuit, 
                while in the Northwest Territories, First Nations people make up the majority.</p>
            <p class="footnote">
                First Nations people are mainly found in south Canada, more specifically: Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, 
                Alberta, and British Columbia.</p>
            <p class="footnote"> Inuit People are mainly found in East Canada, more specifically: Nunavut, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, 
                and Ontario.</p>
            <p class="footnote"> Métis people are mainly found in south Canada, more specifically: Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia, 
                Saskatchewan, and Quebec.</p>

                <h2>How does mental health relate to social/socioeconomic factors in Indigenous and
                    non-Indigenous populations?</h2>

            <p class="footnote">Non-Indigenous individuals consistently exhibit the lowest scores for mental health 
                fair/poor, regardless of gender. First Nations individuals tend to have the highest scores for mental 
                health fair/poor, though their scores are similar to those of Métis people, with First Nations data displaying 
                more pronounced outliers. In contrast, the various Domains, except for First Nations, exhibit relatively close grouping,
                regardless of gender. However, there is limited data available for Inuit individuals, making their analysis challenging.</p>
            <p class = "footnote">
                Non-Indigenous individuals consistently demonstrate the lowest scores for food insecurity, regardless of gender. 
                Notably, the male group in all domains displays considerably less variability compared to both sexes or females. 
                Inuit individuals stand out with significantly higher food insecurity scores, although there is only one data point available.
            </p>
            <p class = "footnote">
                A positive correlation between mental health and food insecurity is observed, indicating that as mental health scores 
                increase, so does food insecurity, as seen across both sexes. It is important to note that the Inuit data point acts as 
                a significant outlier, as it exhibits an average mental health score but an exceptionally high food insecurity score. 
                This suggests that, generally, lower mental health scores correspond to lower food insecurity scores, and vice versa. 
                Gender differences are relatively minor, with average scores slightly lower for males, and data points for males displaying 
                less variability compared to females.
